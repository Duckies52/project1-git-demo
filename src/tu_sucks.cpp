Hullabaloo Caneck Caneck
Hullabaloo, Caneck! Caneck!
Good-bye to texas university
So long to the orange and the white
Good luck to dear old Texas Aggies
They are the boys that show the real old fight
The eyes of Texas are upon you
That is the song they sing so well (Sounds like hell!)
So good-bye to texas university
Were going to beat you all to
Chig-gar-roo-gar-rem
Chig-gar-roo-gar-rem
Rough! Tough! Real Stuff! Texas A&M
